REFLECTION ON MY EXPERIENCE 4.1 Challenges and Growth Biggest Challenge: The most difficult part  was understanding how different countries organize their payroll data and figuring out how to standardize it automatically. Each country had different column names, currencies, and benefit structures. I learned to approach this systematically by analyzing each dataset carefully and   creating detailed mapping", "currencies, and benefit structures. I learned to approach this systematically by analyzing each dataset carefully and   creating detailed mapping documentation.", "Problem-Solving Development: I initially tried to handle all  countries the same way, but quickly learned that flexibility was key. I had to design a system that could adapt to different data structures while maintaining  consistency in the output. This taught me the importance of building scalable, flexible solutions. Technical Growth: Working with real employee data taught me about data privacy, security, and the responsibility that comes with handling sensitive information. I learned that technical solutions must consider not just efficiency, but also trust, accuracy, and user experience. Confidence Building: Successfully  building a system that will be used by thousands of employees gave me confidence in my technical abilities and business judgment. Learning to communicate technical  concepts to HR stakeholders improved my professional communication skills. 5.
